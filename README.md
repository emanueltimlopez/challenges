# #100DaysOfCode

### Hi there! If you're reading this, you're probably interested in the #100DaysOfCode challenge for React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In this challenge, you commit to coding for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days. It may sound daunting, but don't worry! This challenge is a great opportunity to improve your programming skills.

### I'm excited to see what you'll accomplish in these next 100 days! Good luck and have fun!

### Your first components.

- Create three components (in a components folder, each in a different file):
    A - A greeting header that introduces you (using heading tags, two minimum).
